in extra display so that players and refs can see it. Do you it on your own risk, there is
absolutely no warranty!

Software is Chrome web browser extension. You need to fetch and install it to your browser 
to be able to use it. In the future this extension might become available on Chrome web store,
but for now user need to install it 'by hand'.

## What this software does NOT do!

This software is for local use, time is not send to backend servers. 

## Installation instructions
